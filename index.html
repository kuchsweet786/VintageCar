                <span class="history" h1 id="link-2"><strong>History</strong></span>
                <p>The vintage era in the automotive world was a time of transition. The car started off in 1919 as still something of a rarity, and ended up, 
                in 1930, well on the way towards ubiquity. <em>In fact, automobile production at the end of this period was not matched again until the 1950s.</em> 
                In the intervening years, most industrialized countries built nationwide road systems with the result that, towards the end of the period, 
                the ability to negotiate unpaved roads was no longer a prime consideration of automotive design. <strong>today's terms, a vintage car is defined 
                the same as a classic.</strong>
                </p>

        <blockquote>
                <span class="rarity" h1 id="link-3"><strong>Rarity</strong></span>
                <p>Cars that were made in small numbers or often have a higher value but can be more difficult to maintain. Certain year and model cars became popular 
                to turn into hot rods thus destroying their original condition. Other models were produced in such quantities that the price is still not inflated. 
                Market trend is an important part in the price of a vintage car. An "almost" original and in perfect shape model A that was abundantly produced can be 
                purchased for $20,000.00. A collector as an investor would have to know the potential market and have a belief that the future market will bring a return 
                on an investment.

        <blockquote>
                <span class="valuation" h1 id="link-4"><strong>Valuation</strong></span>
                <p>Determining the value of a vintage car can be difficult, as there are many different factors that can potentially influence the price. The age, condition, 
                rarity, modifications, vehicle history and mileage can all drastically change a car's value, among other factors. In recent years, services have begun providing 
                classic and vintage car valuation data to the public, by establishing baseline prices for vehicles in various conditions and publishing marketing trends and 
                forecasts collectors can use to monitor the state of the market. As a result of the variability in car values, most insurers offer agreed value insurance coverage 
                for classic cars. Agreed value coverage involves both the owner and insurance company agreeing on the car's value and insuring it for the agreed amount, as opposed 
                to insuring the car based on industry standard or an average published value.

                <span class="safetyIssues" h1 id="link-5"><strong>Safety Issues</strong></span>
                <p>Antique automobiles and early to middle era classic cars do not have the safety features that are standard on modern cars. The most rudimentary of safety features, 
                front wheel brakes and hydraulic brakes, began appearing on cars in the 1920s and 1930s respectively.

                <span class="collecting" h1 id="link-6"><strong>Collecting</strong></span>
                <p>For the average person car collecting is a hobby. A person can have a fascination with a certain vehicle, make or a history with one so seeks a particular make or model. 
                Finding such a car at an affordable price is not always hard but the price will depend on the condition or the desired end result. Usually the less work required on a 
                vehicle equates to a higher price, the more work required means a cheaper initial cost, but often more in the long run, and a person's level of restoration experience plays an 
                important part.
