# Car

-our app is a place where the user can search for a car but selection a maker. 
-to narrow it down, the user can search for a car in specific area byt entering zip code.
-one the user enters both info and click search, the web will give a list of cars, 
with dealers info and few details.
-
- in our project we tried using three APIs but we were onl able to use 2 APIs. 
- 1st API is to get info of the car, and dealer detail.
-2nd API connects with the 1st API and narrow the list down by zipcode.
